WINSOL (formerly cd-crisol) is a tool that allows us to create CDs and DVDs of open source software for Windows quickly and easily using only a PC and an Internet connection.

Through the options it provides, you can select the applications you want to include in our composition, or even add your own applications. Once selected applications, select the presentation you want for our composition. Also to avoid you have to generate the composition, we provide a set of compositions ready for download.

Finally, we will generate a file in the format you prefer: support recording applications (iso) or ready to unpack in your disk or USB Memory (zip).

Download our custom composition will be as easy as clicking on a link will receive in our email.
